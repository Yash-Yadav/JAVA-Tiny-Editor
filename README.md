# JAVA-Tiny-Editor
## What is JAVA Tiny Editor?
  JAVA Tiny Editor is an Application made to run on Microsoft Windows OS running Dot Net Framework v4 and above.
  This tiny Editor does your work easy, especially when you are working with JAVA language and using only Notepad as a Text editor.

## Why should I even use it?
  Usually you have to do some coding in the Notepad, then go to Command Prompt then Run few commands and then again go back to Notepad to do some changes in the code (if required).
  So This tiny editor _(Size: less than 500KB)_ helps you by proving a coding interface via a TextBox and a Read-Only TextBox for Output as well as Errors.
  So here you only have to run the Software and _Voila_ there you go with your code...
